# Analyzing LinkedIn Job Market

This project is about analyzing industry trends in the LinkedIn job market with an application of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling on job descriptions, followed by dimensionality reduction using t-SNE and UMAP to visualize semantic clusters.

## Details
- **Target Industries** – Tech & IT, Finance & Banking, Healthcare & Medicine, Manufacturing & Production, Legal & Compliance, Engineering & Construction, Transportation & Logistics, Media & Entertainment, Energy & Environment, and Retail & Consumer Goods.
- **Clustering Evaluation** – Compared multiple algorithms: K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering, GMM, DBSCAN, and Spectral Clustering—using word sampling to assess coherence and separation.
- **Experimentation** – Initial experiments used Word2Vec for text representation; future work proposes upgrading to contextual embeddings like BERT.

## Tech Stack
- **Primary Language & Libraries**: Python (scikit-learn, umap-learn, NumPy, pandas)
- **Analysis Environment**: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
- **NLP & Topic Modeling**: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
- **Clustering Algorithms**: K-Means, DBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering, Spectral Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Silhouette Score (SC), Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI), Calinski-Harabasz Index (CHI)


## 👤 My Role
- Conducted review of related literature (RRL) on clustering algorithms (K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering, GMM, DBSCAN, Spectral Clustering), topic modeling (LDA), and dimensionality reduction techniques (t-SNE, UMAP) to inform methodological choices
- Researched the theoretical foundations and comparative strengths of Word2Vec, BERT-based embeddings, BERTopic, and Top2Vec to evaluate their applicability in job market trend analysis
- Collaborated with a developer in the group by translating research findings into actionable guidance for algorithm selection
